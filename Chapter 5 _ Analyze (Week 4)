The table includes columns for track_id, track_name (name of the music track), composer, and bytes (digital storage size of the music track). 
You are only interested in data about the classical musician Johann Sebastian Bach. You want to know the size of each Bach track in kilobytes. 
You decide to divide bytes by 1000 to get the size in kilobytes, and use the AS command to store the result in a new column called kilobytes. 

Add a statement to your SQL query that calculates the size in kilobytes for each track and stores it in a new column as kilobytes.

NOTE: The three dots (...) indicate where to add the statement.

SELECT
track_id,
track_name,
composer,
bytes,
bytes / 1000 AS kilobytes
FROM
track
WHERE
composer = "Johann Sebastian Bach"

What is the size in kilobytes of the track with Id number 3407?

Add a statement to your SQL query that calculates the average total and stores it in a new column as average_total.

NOTE: The three dots (...) indicate where to add the statement.
SELECT
billing_country,
